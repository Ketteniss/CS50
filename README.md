# cs50

 Over my summerbreak I went through CS50 lectures that are avaible online.

   They first taught me fundamentals of C-language (syntax, data types, files, garbage collection).
   
       Cool things I programmed in C (within the course's problem sets): 
           - Creditcard validator (Based on Luhn's algorithm)
           - Bitmap filter (Blur, Grayscale, Reflect, Edges)
           - Spellchecker (Using dictionary)
   
   After those we jumped over to python language rebuilding similar programms within only a few minutes, 
   a powerful showcase of pythons potential to increase productivity when it manages tedious tasks are under the hood for us.

   Then followed up with introducing SQLite to me, which I wasnt familiar with yet.
   
   Unfortunatly I didnt finish the last 3 lectures since my summer break ended at this point.
   
   Overall very cool and interesting material!
