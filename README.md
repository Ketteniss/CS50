# CS50

 Over my summerbreak I followed a few CS50 lectures which are avaible online.

   Learned basic C-language (syntax, data types, files, garbage collection).
   
       Neat programs I build in C following the material: 
           - Creditcard validator (Based on Luhn's algorithm)
           - Bitmap filter (Blur, Grayscale, Reflect, Edges)
           - Spellchecker (Using dictionary)
   
   After those we jumped over to python language rebuilding similar programms within only a few minutes, 
   a powerful showcase of pythons potential to increase productivity when it manages tedious tasks are under the hood for us.

   Then followed up with introducing SQLite to me, which I wasnt familiar with yet.
   
   Unfortunatly I didnt finish the last 3 lectures since my summer break ended at this point.
   
   Overall very cool and interesting material!
