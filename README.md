# cs50

 Over my summerbreak I went through CS50 classes 1-7.

   First it taught me the fundamentals of C-language (syntax, types, garbage collection)

   Then it made me appreciate python language for managing many low level tasks and thus 
   increasing productivity, making the programming process less prone to error, etc.
 
   Then showing me SQLite 
  
   Didnt complete the last 3 lectures since summer break ended 
   Overall very cool and interesting material!
