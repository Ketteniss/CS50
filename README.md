# CS50

 Over my summerbreak I followed a few CS50 lectures which are avaible online.

   Learned basic C-language (syntax, data types, files, garbage collection).
   
       Neat programs I build in C following the material: 
           - Creditcard validator (Based on Luhn's algorithm)
           - Bitmap filter (Blur, Grayscale, Reflect, Edges)
           - Spellchecker (Using dictionary)
   
   After those we jumped over to python language rebuilding similar programms within only a few minutes, 
   a powerful showcase of pythons potential to increase productivity in the programming process as it automatically 
   manages low level tasks.
   
   Unfortunatly couldnt finish with every lecture as my summer break ended.
   Overall very cool and interesting material!
